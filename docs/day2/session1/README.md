Collaborating with others on a GitHub project
=============================================

Learning objectives:

- To learn how to use the issue tracker for project management.
- To learn how to add people to a project, refer to them throughout the platform (e.g.
  in `commit` messages and issues), and track their contributions through timelines and
  contributions.
- To learn how to handle potentially drastic and risky changes through branching, forking,
  and pull requests.
