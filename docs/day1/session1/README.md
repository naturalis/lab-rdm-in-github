Understanding data management and version control
=================================================

Learning objectives:

- To understand the pitfalls of poor data management strategies and the need for open 
  science approaches.
- To appreciate the similarities between digital open science and open source, and the
  possibility of 'comparing notes' and adopting useful techniques.
- To understand what 'version control' is and how it is useful for distributed 
  collaboration on projects that produce digital artefacts (data files, analysis code,
  visualizations, manuscripts).
