# Research data management in GitHub

Scientific research is increasingly collaborative, international, and digital. These developments provide positive impetus
for developing good practices in research data management: the 'carrot'. At the same time, the requirements of funding
agencies, calls for reproducibility, and bad behavior, intentional or otherwise, are the 'stick' that
also drives researchers towards accountable and transparent data management. Recent years have seen a great deal of
communication about what data management practices should aspire to in the abstract, but practical guidelines are less
well developed. In this two days course we present the GitHub platform as a useful tool for file and project management
as a single user, and for distributed collaboration all the way to publishing the project outcomes.
